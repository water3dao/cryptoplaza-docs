# ThePlaza: Twitter on ENS

## Overview

Social media is a gold mine for [scammers](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/30/6-outrageous-moments-in-crypto-twitter-scam-history/). Since 2021, more than 46,000 people have reported losing over [$1 billion](https://www.outlookindia.com/business/crypto-scam-victims-lost-in-excess-of-1-billion-since-2021-us-federal-trade-commission-news-200354) in crypto to scams and crypto makes it attractive to scammers.

There are many Twitter accounts claiming the "vitalik.eth" on Twitter, but [Twitter Blue](https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-blue-check-verification-buy-scams/) still cannot fix it. Behind the scene of "[Not giving away ETH](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/970245720560123904)", there are victims of the social media scam.

## What we do?

We move a step forward to the open Internet. We will not say "Don't be evil", and keep detecting and blocking these kinds of scams. Instead, we move to "Can't be evil", trusting “good users” is replaced by cryptographic ownership of digital assets and mathematical proofs of security, securied by ENS.


ThePlaza, Twitter on ENS, has two advantages:

- Reduce Scam: Our product is encuried by ENS account and verified on-chain: This will also eliminate fake accounts and reduce spam.
- ENS profile verification: we connect web3 identities in social networks, the real ENS identities. A lot of ENS users are looking for verification ENS on Twitter. CryptoPlaza will help connect real ENS holders. ENS is not just a display name, it will be verified in more DAPPs.
