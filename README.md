# CryptoPlaza: Crypto Twitter login with ENS

## Purpose
The water3 team is building a crypto twitter based on ENS - name CryptoPlaza. This will bring two advantages to ENS:

Account ownership: The user logs in with ENS. The account belongs to the user, and no one can tamper or ban it. Recently, many ENS related Twitter accounts were suspended, e.g. [Furyan.eth](https://twitter.com/FuryanEth/status/1589752021095452673). Therefore, account Ownership is Crucial.
ENS verified on-chain: This will eliminate fake accounts and reduce spam. A lot of ENS users are calling for Musk to verify ENS on Twitter. CryptoPlaza will allow real ENS holders to have a social platform.
ENS is not just a domain name, it will be verified in more DAPPs.

## Scope of work
The crypto twitter includes the following core functions:

ENS login (verified on Ethereum Mainnet)
tweet (off-chain for v1.0)
social function: follow, unfollow
user profile page
Plaza: explore content of ENS user

## Timeline
Our team started development in September. Weâ€™ve done most of the work in the past 11 weeks.

The project will go live on December 15th.

## Our Team
Water3 is a project team of volunteer developers, and our members are ENS users. We are committed to developing Web3 applications that meet the needs.
Freedom means we are free to choose. And we will develop decentralized applications to give users more options.
